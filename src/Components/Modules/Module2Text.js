export const MOD_2_DESC = `Welcome to Module 2 of MAPmaker. In this module you will examine your social context in order to assess how the people, places, and groups in your life have supported and inhibited your growth. Specifically, you will consider the values and beliefs that you associate with these influences, and start to disentangle your own authentic values and beliefs from those of the influences around you.
<br><br>
Gaining clarity on the influences that shape our lives can be difficult, but the next few exercises will guide you as you begin this process. A first step is realizing that while our environment is important, we are not wholly determined by it. We have the power to choose our own direction for life, and this is at the core of the Self-acceptance element of the MAPPERS model. Self-acceptance arises when we are able to differentiate ourselves, our values, and our beliefs from those around us, and then accept ourselves for who we are even though others may choose differently.
<br><br>
This module will ease you into this important form of self-reflection, and help you establish a strong foundation of relational awareness and Self-acceptance.`

export const QUES_210_DESC = `In this exercise, you will list the most important <i>contextual influences</i> that impact you in your life.  By contextual influences we mean the most important people, places, cultures, and ideas that are around you. Contextual influences are an important place to start a self-reflection process because we are all social beings who live among a continual throng of ideas, opinions, values, beliefs, and expectations. These influential voices shape us and inform how we live, think, and behave in our everyday life.
<br><br>
Your surrounding influences offer you a mix of values and beliefs. By "values and beliefs" we mean the things that they care about, how they see the world, and the ideas that they impress on you directly or indirectly. Some of your influences may seem entirely positive and supportive to your well-being, others may seem entirely negative and inhibiting to your growth, development, or authenticity, and sometimes influences may be both supportive and inhibiting in different ways.
<br><br>
While some of your influences will be very obvious to you, others may not be as immediately apparent. For instance, a parent who stood for values that you care deeply about (e.g., honesty, hard work, loyalty) is easy to name and understand as a supportive influence. But were there other people in your life who may not have been major characters in your daily life, but who were important in helping you identify values that have ultimately shaped you? For instance, was there a more distant relative or acquaintance who embodied values that you disliked (e.g., dishonesty, laziness, disloyalty), and who impacted who you decided not to be? Or were there peers, social groups, or even cultural forces (like books, TV shows, or common beliefs) that you looked to with aspiration, and that influenced what you value and how you live from afar?
<br><br>
In order to help you be thorough, we have divided your possible influences into three categories:
<br><br>
<i>1. Personal Relationships:</i>  These are all the individuals who now or in the past have directly influenced you positively, negatively, or both.
<br><br>
<i>2. Social Groups and Ideologies:</i>  These are specific groups to which you belong or have belonged, or schools of thought and ideologies to which you have subscribed. These affiliations can be personally chosen or not.
<br><br>
<i>3. Wider Communities and Cultural Groups:</i>  These are also groups to which you belong or have belonged, but the scope is much wider. As a result, the influence may be a bit more indirect.
<br><br>
Within each category, simply fill in the names of any influences that are meaningful to you in your current or past life, whether they are positively supportive of who you are and who you want to become, negatively inhibiting of who you are and who you want to become, or both supportive and inhibiting to you are and who you want to become.
<br><br>
You are free to fill in as many influences, values, and beliefs as you would like as long as they are meaningful and impactful to your current life or past development. And since any influence can offer several different values or beliefs, feel free to list any of your influences multiple times.`

export const QUES_220_DESC = `In the previous exercise you listed the contextual influences in your life and how they have affected your growth. Now you will choose which of these influences have been most important for supporting or inhibiting who you are and who you want to become.
<br><br>
In this exercise you will focus entirely on your supportive influences, before considering your inhibiting influences in the next exercise. Supportive influences play an important role in helping us to recognize, accept, and develop our most authentic values and beliefs. In this way, supportive influences can embolden us to grow and cultivate greater meaning in life.`

export const QUES_230_DESC = `In the previous exercise you selected the most important influences that have helped you grow by supporting your values and beliefs. Now you will choose which of your influences have most significantly inhibited your authentic values and beliefs.
<br><br>
By recognizing when others have prevented us from living through our deepest values and beliefs, we can begin to differentiate ourselves from our influences, strengthen our Self-acceptance, and take steps to live in alignment with our most authentic selves.`

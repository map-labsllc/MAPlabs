export const MOD_5_DESC = `<p>Each of the previous modules walked you through specific elements that build and nourish a life of meaning and purpose. This final module takes everything that you have completed to date and pulls it together into an organized process that helps you to create both a clarifying Life Purpose Statement, and a set of commitments and goals that can direct your actions toward achieving your purpose.
</p>
<br />

<p>As we previously learned, there is a lot more to purpose than simply writing an inspirational sentence or two and posting it on the wall. Such statements have value only when they encapsulate a deep well of self-knowledge gained through reflection. But when they do, they serve as a useful shorthand that can be internalized and used as a guide through our everyday activities, sifting through the various pressures and incentives that come with them, helping us to remain focused on what truly matters to us.
 </p>
<br />
<p>We will approach the task of articulating a Purpose Statement by developing a MAPmaker Dashboard. This will compile the most critical information created in MAPmaker thus far. The Dashboard will not only provide a context of self-understanding as you turn toward developing your Life Purpose Statement, but it will also provide a quick-reference guide to which you can return on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis after completing the MAPmaker program.
</p>
<br />

<p>Module 5 develops the framework of your life purpose in four phases. As you will see, each phase is built from all of the work completed thus far in Modules 1 through 4. That way, your results are grounded in the weeks’ worth of thoughtful self-reflection, authentic self-knowledge, and personal strengths understanding that you have already developed.
</p>
<br />

<ol>
  <li>The first phase will establish the <b><i>context</i></b> of your purpose-seeking life by grounding you in a solid understanding of where you are today, where you want to go in the future, and the key meaning and purpose themes that you discovered and articulated throughout the previous four modules.</li>
  <li>The second will focus on the <b><i>“who,”</i></b> that is, <i>who</i> you are based on the personal elements that you examined and articulated in the previous modules: your personal sense of <i>meaning</i>; your greatest <i>desires</i>, which arise out of your sense of meaning; and your signature <i>strengths</i>. These three elements represent who you are innately based on your values and beliefs, your deepest emotions, and your aptitudes and abilities. It is important that your sustainable sense of life purpose be rooted in the intrinsics of <i>who</i> you are, not in the extrinsic forces and influences around you.</li>
  <li>The third phase will focus on the <b><i>“what,”</i></b> that is, <i>what</i> you care about most that is <i>beyond yourself</i>. We are all social beings who live in relation to other friends and family, cultures and societies, and broader ideas and values. In fact, as mentioned in earlier modules, positive relationships are the number one indicator of well-being. So the third phase will seek to connect what you care about most that is beyond yourself, with your most authentic self that you focused on in the second phase. Establishing your <i>context</i>, acknowledging <i>who</i> you are, and articulating <i>what</i> you care about beyond yourself are the core elements of human purpose. After naming these, you will be able to form your own Life Purpose Statement.</li>
  <li>The fourth phase will focus on the <b><i>“how.”</i></b> Here we consider <i>how</i> you will prepare yourself to implement your sense of purpose by leveraging two additional elements of life purpose, your <i>commitments</i> and <i>goals</i>. Every Purpose Statement implies a practical orientation, a way we intend to act in the world. Commitments are the heart of that intention, because implementing purpose can be hard, full of temptations along the way to drift into a path of least resistance. Commitment implies both a specific scope of action and a will to stay the course. You will likely revise your sense of purpose through experimentation along the way, but commitments ensure that the changes you make are deliberate, rather than reactive. With commitments in place, goals focus on how you will make good on your commitments on an everyday basis. They translate your intention to act into step-by-step execution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations on coming this far! For all the effort we exert in our various life tasks, very few people engage in the kind of self-reflection that you have over the last four modules. We hope that this will be only a jumpstart in a lifelong journey toward purpose, but having worked through MAPmaker, you will have the core tools you need to make progress on your own.

<h3>The Context of Your Purpose</h3>
<p>Over the last four modules, you created key summary statements about yourself and your needs. Several exercises in this final module will give you an opportunity to revise the statements that you previously composed, before they are added to your MAPmaker Dashboard.
</p>

<p><b>Revise and condense your Current Situation Statement.</b> In Module 1 you were instructed to write a full description of your current state of mind, state of being, and general assessment of your current condition, capturing how you feel, what you think of your situation, what is good and bad, and how you would describe your current self to your future self. Take a moment to read over this statement and reflect on how accurate it feels now that you have nearly completed the program.
</p>

<p>Make sure your statement encompasses what you have learned through the first four modules so that it accurately reflects your understanding at this point. Does your description of your Current Situation feel accurate, authentic, and comprehensive to you? If so, feel free to leave it as it is. If not, revise or edit it to more accurately reflect your current self-knowledge and understanding. 
</p>

<p>Since this statement will now become part of your “quick-reference” Dashboard, try to consolidate it down into a simple, to-the-point synopsis of only the most important concepts in a few sentences.

<li>Do your themes feel accurate, authentic, comprehensive, and empowering to you? If so, feel free to leave them as they are. If not, revise or edit them to more accurately reflect your current self-knowledge and understanding.</li>
<li>Note which themes seem most critical to you, and which seem secondary. If your themes seem to overlap, try to consolidate them. Then choose only the most critical themes that you would like to add to your Dashboard.

<h3>Your Purpose Statement</h3>
<p>Bring the Dashboard elements together into a Purpose Statement. Our lives are most purposeful when a few things hold true: (1) we know what is most meaningful to us, (2) our desires arise out of this meaning, (3) we fulfill our desires through our personal strengths, and (4) we apply our strengths in service of something or someone beyond ourselves.
</p>
<p>
In Modules 1 - 4, you worked through a process of separating yourself from all the extrinsic influences that have fought for your attention all of your life. This allowed you to discover what is most intrinsically meaningful to you. From this place of self-understanding, you then worked through the trade-off exercise to discover what you most deeply desire. Then you took the VIA Survey of Character Strengths to understand which strengths you possess to animate your meaning and accomplish your desires. And all
along, you considered how your meaning, desires, and strengths could apply to something beyond yourself.
</p>
<p>
Your Dashboard now contains many elements of a purposeful life: the thematic elements that give your life a context, your grounded sense of what is most meaningful to you, your awareness and articulation of what you desire most, a list of your greatest strengths, and your outward-looking understanding of how these things can be channeled toward service beyond yourself. These elements can help you to articulate how to live your life more purposefully.
</p>
<p>
It is now time for you to bring these elements together into a Purpose Statement.
</p>
<p>
Take some time to consider all of the elements on your Dashboard. Then articulate your own personal Life Purpose Statement based on how who you are can meaningfully connect to what you care about in order to better serve yourself and something beyond yourself. Complete the following statement in the most authentic and precise way you can.</p>`

export const QUES_550_DESC = `
<h3>The How of Purpose</h3>
<p>Now that you have articulated a Life Purpose Statement, it is time to begin working on <i>how</i> it can materialize in your life.
</p>
<p><b>Focus on commitment.</b> You may recall that commitment is another one of the core elements of the definition of purpose. At this point in your purpose journey, you may have discovered something to which you have been committed for a long time and just never realized it—or you may now have new insights that you did not have before about how you
can direct your life to make it more meaningful and purposeful. Either way, commitment to developing your purpose (even when you do not know exactly how to execute it) is the critical next step.
</p>
<p>
In order to progress from stating a life purpose, as you did in the last exercise, to implementing your life of purpose, you will benefit from having a few specific commitments to which you are dedicated for the long term. By creating commitments out of the most important elements of <i>personal growth</i>, <i>relationships</i>, and <i>engagement mastery</i> that you developed in the previous modules, you will begin to architect your life into one that is capable of manifesting your life purpose, and seeing it through in a committed way.
</p>
<p>
The challenge in this section is to narrow your commitments down to <i>only the most critical and salient</i> efforts that will help you build toward your life purpose. For many people, this means having the clarity to choose just one primary commitment to which they are single-mindedly dedicated. For others, this may mean having two or three commitment areas that they need to further develop in order to be prepared or equipped to fulfill their purpose. But having too many commitments leads to too much diffusion of effort, and often leads to both a sense of being overwhelmed by how much there is to do, and to not seeing enough near-term progress on any one measure or initiative to develop positive momentum for one’s purpose.
</p>
<p>
The next exercises will lead you through a process of establishing your primary commitment(s). This process will anchor your efforts in your <i>personal growth</i> commitments, and then help you to support these commitments with the <i>relationships</i> and <i>masteries</i> that are needed to see them through. As a result, your primary commitments will be multidimensional, contextualized by your relationships (existing and new), and well-supported by both your personal growth and your developing senses of mastery in order to give them greater definition and a greater chance of success.
</p>
<p>Personal growth is the most intrinsic of your commitments because it is focused on how you personally develop and who your personal self becomes. This is why you are starting the <i>how</i> of your purpose with <i>personal growth</i>, because personal growth not only develops you into a person who is qualified to accomplish your purposeful activities, but it also makes your purpose pathway sustainable. A sustainable life purpose is one that you personally love and benefit from because it intrinsically grows <i>you</i> in ways that you desire, and in ways that continually develop you for the next phases of your life of purpose. In this way, a purposeful life becomes regenerating. As you invest yourself in your purpose and in serving something beyond yourself, you also receive back through personal growth and development. Consequently, you will start your commitment process by anchoring on the most intrinsic type of commitments, the commitments to personal growth that are necessary for you to accomplish your stated purpose.
</p>
<p>
At the end of each module you were asked to identify areas of <i>personal growth</i> in that module’s subject. Review your responses about areas of personal growth.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Do your responses feel accurate, authentic, comprehensive, and empowering to you? If so, feel free to leave them as they are. If not, revise or edit them to more accurately reflect your current self-knowledge and understanding.
  <li>Note which responses seem most critical to you achieving your Life Purpose Statement, and which seem secondary. If your responses seem to overlap, feel free to consolidate them.</li>
  <li>Choose the 1 - 3 most critical areas of <i>personal growth</i> that are necessary, and to which you are willing to commit, in order to support the development of your life purpose. These commitments will make up your <i>primary</i> commitments in order to focus you on the most critical areas of growth and personal investment. The commitments you select will automatically be added to your Dashboard.</li>
</ol>`

export const QUES_551_DESC = `<p>Relationships provide the support for our personal growth and the context for fulfilling life purpose. No one is an island, and without the support of positive relationships from friends, family, mentors, teachers, and others, none of us are able to grow in the ways necessary to accomplish our purposes. So your next commitment is to the relationships
that will support you in your personal growth and that will provide the appropriate context for the fulfillment of your purpose.
</p>
<p>
At the end of each module you were asked what <i>relationships</i> you need to support that module’s subject. Review your responses about relationships.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Do your responses feel accurate, authentic, comprehensive, and empowering to you? If so, feel free to leave them as they are. If not, revise or edit them to more accurately reflect your current self-knowledge and understanding.</li>
  <li>Note which responses seem most critical not only to achieving your Life Purpose Statement, but also to supporting the personal growth commitments you just chose. If your responses seem to overlap, feel free to consolidate them.</li>
  <li>Choose the 1 - 3 most critical <i>relationships</i> (that you either currently have or that you need to develop in the future) that are necessary, and to which you are willing to commit, in order to support the areas of personal growth which you previously chose.</li>
</ol>
`

export const QUES_552_DESC = `
<p>
Thus far you have committed to both the <i>personal growth</i> that is necessary for you to accomplish your purpose, and to the <i>relationships</i> that will provide you with the support and context you need to continually grow and serve your purpose. Now you will commit to the ways in which your personal growth and relationships can lead you to <i>engagement mastery</i>, that is, to developing mastery in the skills, capabilities, or areas of expertise and knowledge that you need in order to manifest your purpose through your engagements.
</p>
<p>At the end of each module you were asked what <i>engagement mastery</i> you need in order to support that module’s subject. Review your responses about engagement mastery.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Do your responses feel accurate, authentic, comprehensive, and empowering to you? If so, feel free to leave them as they are. If not, revise or edit them to more accurately reflect your current self-knowledge and understanding.</li>
  <li>Note which responses seem most critical to achieving your Life Purpose Statement, and which seem secondary. If your responses seem to overlap, feel free to consolidate them.</li>
  <li>Choose the 1 - 3 most critical <i>engagement masteries</i> that are necessary, and to which you are willing to commit, in order to support your previously chosen commitments to personal growth and relationships.</li>
</ol>

export const QUES_560_DESC = `
<p>
Contemplate your Goals. The fourth and final core element of the definition of purpose is goal-orientation. You wrote your life purpose statement by articulating how you will use your meaning, desire, and strengths to serve something beyond yourself. You then articulated how you will commit to building your purpose through personal growth, relationships, and engagement mastery. Now it is time to become even more concrete through listing specific goals that will support a life centered on your purpose.
</p>
<p>
As you develop your goals here, try to write them in a way that is both (1) specific and (2) challenging. Organizational psychologists Edwin Locke and Gary Latham have studied goal- setting over many years and identified these as the two elements of goals that bring about the most dramatic results. And it makes intuitive sense. There is little use in striving for something if you cannot say what it is that you are striving for. And if you are not challenged, achieving the goal may not bringing out the very best in you—not to mention that achieving the goal would leave you in a position not very different from the one you started from. The idea recalls what we discussed in Module 3 about “flow,” the experience of rising to a challenge that brings us up to the outer limit of our strengths. Let your goal-setting create a context for you to experience flow on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>
</p>At the end of each module you were asked what you needed to break from and build to with regard to that module’s subject: feelings and experiences, values and beliefs, desires, and strengths. Review your responses about what you wanted break from and build toward.
<ol>
  <li>Do your responses feel accurate, authentic, comprehensive, and empowering to you? If so, feel free to leave them as they are. If not, revise, edit, or add new ones to them to more accurately reflect your current self-knowledge and understanding.</li>
  <li>Note which responses seem most critical to achieving your life purpose statement, and which seem secondary. If your responses seem to overlap, feel free to consolidate them. Then choose the most critical break from and build to goals that are necessary in
  order to support the achievement of your life purpose, and attach them to your final commitments on your dashboard.

At the very beginning of the MAPmaker process you wrote a Future Desired Situation statement articulating what you most desired in your future. Now that you have completed nearly all of the MAPmaker program, it is time to revisit this statement to see how it stands up to the learning you have encountered. Reread the statement and make sure that it encompasses what you have learned through all five modules, and that it accurately reflects all of your understanding at this point. Does your description of your Future Desired Situation feel accurate, authentic, comprehensive, and empowering to you? If so, feel free to leave it as it is. If not, revise or edit it to more accurately reflect your current self-knowledge and understanding.

<h3>Bringing It All Together</h3>
<p>
At this point you have engaged in thoughtful self-reflection, developed a core of self- knowledge, articulated your purpose, and identified the commitments and goals needed to act on it. Now it is time to pull it all together and put it in motion! We need occasional periods of intense reflection, but engagement is central to purpose; our thinking must translate into action.
</p>
<p>
We have brought together the most important elements of your MAPmaker work into a MAPmaker Dashboard.
</p>
<p>
The MAPmaker Dashboard is your quick-glance reminder of the critical elements of your self-discovery process. This Dashboard is a logistical tool that can be used on a daily or weekly basis to keep you focused on what you have decided is most important to you. This Dashboard contains the elements of each phase of your reflection, and it is arranged simply and linearly to provide you with the critical components of your personal self archeology, as well as the guidance that you have created for yourself to help you activate the next phase of your life purpose development.
</p>
<p>
Review your Dashboard now and consider how you can use this distillation of your work to keep your reflection, commitments, and goals top of mind as you segue out of intense reflection and into activation. Only you can decide how this Dashboard can best serve you, but some ideas for consideration are:
<ul>
  <li>
  Put in your calendar a time to review the entire Dashboard once a day for the next week to more deeply internalize the results of your process, and to keep your insights and understandings fresh in your mind. If this feels like a practice from which you would benefit by continuing it beyond the next week, then continue it by extending your calendaring of the daily review. Otherwise, after your first week reduce your calendared review of the Dashboard to a few times a week, then once a week, twice a month, once a month, etc ... based on your personal needs. Regardless of the frequency, we highly recommend calendaring a periodic a review of the Dashboard so that life doesn’t end up coming between you and your life purpose development.
  </li>
  <li>
  Choose the elements of the Dashboard that are most important to you at any given time, the elements that are most salient to keep top of mind in your daily life, and make them prominent. This may mean printing out a section of the Dashboard and leaving it on your desk or refrigerator, or maybe it means taking a screenshot of a relevant section and making it the wallpaper of your computer or phone.
  </li>
  <li>
  We can’t encourage you enough to keep up the journaling practice that you established during your MAPmaker work. Integrate your dashboard elements into your ongoing journaling practice. Perhaps you could go back through the dashboard linearly, journaling about each element sequentially over weeks so that you re-experience the key insights and discoveries of your MAPmaker journey each day. This could become a practice you return to periodically in order to always keep your life purpose journey fresh in your everyday life. And when you are not journaling about the entire journey, you could select the elements that seem most relevant to you on a certain days, weeks, or months to focus on, using the Dashboard data to remind, inspire, and hold you accountable in the areas on which you are focusing during that time.
  </li>
  <li>
  Use the Dashboard to develop an  action plan to get from where you are today to where you want to be as an active engager in your life purpose. Many of us have worked with long- term planning models, whether in school, volunteer work, or our careers. If there is a model that has worked for you in the past, use that to frame the elements of the Dashboard so that you have a formal conception and framework against which you can act. If you do not have a model that you have previously used, feel free to improvise and create one that fits who you are and how you best operate. This will likely be a long-term, multi-year endeavor, so do not feel like you need to have every step perfectly articulated. But take on the elements that you know how to take on in the near-term, and return to your plan
  periodically to update it, using the Dashboard to help you to determine the elements of your next phases.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ways in which you can use the Dashboard to assist you in your ongoing life purpose development. In the future, MAPlabs hopes to be able to add additional functionality to the MAPmaker platform that will leverage and extend the Dashboard data to assist users in their life purpose processes.
</p>

<p>The MAPPERS Model takes the same critical Dashboard data and puts it into a visual model that demonstrates how your MAPmaker results come together into a process of intentional transformation for your life. This model is more visual than the Dashboard, and it provides descriptive phrases, arrows, and section headings to create a sense of movement and relationship about your process. The elements of your Dashboard do not exist in isolation. They will be most helpful to you if you know how they relate to the other elements, and how to use them in a comprehensive and coordinated effort to build a life of meaning and purpose.
</p>
<p>As you examine your model, and as you re-examine it in the future, consider the sense of narrative that it creates. We mention this now because the notion of narrative is used by many of the life meaning and purpose researchers and theorists. In a meta-review article entitled “A Roadmap for Meaning Research and Applications,” which overviews the leading research and theories of meaning, Paul T. P. Wong says the following about narrative as a device for structuring meaning:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    “Narrativeconstructionallowsfortheexaminationandtransformationofnegativeevents into positives to make life meaningful. More important, it provides a framework that integrates the different fragments of one’s life to produce a coherent narrative identity.”
  </li>
  <li>
    “...acoherentlifestoryhelpsmakesenseoflifeand‘providesbothtemporalandcausal explanations for events.... These well-defined narratives place the self contextually in space and time and integrate the person’s life experience and self-concept, thereby providing a sense of a self with purpose (McAdams, 2006).’”
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you move from introspection and self-reflection into acting on your stated purpose, commitments, and goals, the MAPPERS Model can assist you in understanding how all of your key insights and discoveries work together. The MAPPERS Model inserts your key findings into a narrative to articulate how you will move from your current situation to your desired future situation. Seeing their relationship to each other, and how each builds upon
another, you can begin to construct your own well-defined narrative that integrates the elements of your life into a coherent self-concept and identity.
</p>
<p>As one-off insights or discoveries, these elements of your self-conception are less apt to stand up to the forces of inertia that may work against them in this transitional stage of your current life. But as part of a greater narrative that articulates your more authentic self- conception and identity, each element is as strong as the whole, and this whole self will be able to establish and build its own momentum that can overcome and replace whatever current forces of inertia your “pre-purpose” life holds.
</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions about using the MAPPERS Model:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take some time to emotionally “place yourself” in the narrative of the MAPPERS Model. Review the overall flow of the model and the elements that have come from your work to internalize where you were when you started this process, what you have come to realize during it, and where you intend to go from this point forward.
  </li>
  <li>After reviewing the overall flow and narrative of the model, go back to the bottom and focus more deeply on each element sequentially. As you focus on each element, internally gauge whether or not you feel that you have resolution and comfort with that specific element of the model. If you feel that you have appropriated and resolved the needs of the first element, then move to the next one. But when you sense that there are unresolved issues or needs with an element, stop at that element, name the issues or needs that need to be faced, and focus on the ways you can address the needs. Do not be in a hurry to resolve the issue and move on. It is much more important that you truly deal with your specific issues than that you race through the model.
  </li>
  <li>As you find yourself stopping at elements in the model that need further resolution, look to the top of the model to see if some of your stated commitments, goals, and break/build prescriptions point to ways of addressing and resolving the issues. If, for instance, you stop at the very first element in the model that includes your Current Situation statement because you feel that something is not resolved, then name the part of that statement that you want to address, and then see if the items you listed in your personal growth, relationships, or engagement mastery elements are relevant to resolving your named need.
  </li>
  <li>Like the Dashboard, the MAPPERS Model is a reference tool to be used over and again. Whether you review the model once a day, once a week, or once a month, use this model and the narrative it provides to continually alert yourself to your core needs and the intended actions you have planned to take you forward in your life toward living with more meaning and life purpose.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In an article entitled, “Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change,” and then later in her book The How of Happiness, Sonja Lyubomirsky, demonstrates how research shows that our degree of life satisfaction is determined by 3 critical elements.
</p>
<p>About 50% of our life satisfaction is based on our personality “set point,” that is, who we are when we come into this life in terms of our genetic make-up and our innate aptitudes and strengths. While we cannot fundamentally change our set points, we can certainly do a lot to influence whether they are working for us or against us. With clear self-knowledge, we can set up our lives to live in ways that give us the joy of harmonizing with our set point characteristics, and that allow us to more naturally feel the flow of a life that synchronizes with who we are organically. But unfortunately, without clear self-knowledge, many of us live in ways that battle against our set point characteristics, making our lives a struggle against our most authentic natures.
<p>Throughout the last four modules, you have spent many hours gaining clarity about your authentic nature. You have considered which influences in your life are supportive of, and which are inhibitive to, your deepest self, just as you have examined your top strengths to understand who you are most predisposed to be. Your investment in this self-knowledge will serve to ground you in the elements of your self that are set so that you can harmonize with them instead of fighting against them.
</p>
<p>The second element of life satisfaction, and the one most of us consider when thinking about changing our lives, is our circumstances. Perhaps we think that a new job will change things. Or we may feel that new possessions, such as cars, houses, or more income, will provide us with more happiness. Or maybe we try even more drastic changes, such as new relationships or moving to an entirely new place, in order to help us transform our lives. While circumstances do have impact, according to Lyubomirsky, research shows that changing our circumstances only impacts our life satisfaction by about 10%.
</p>
<p>Like many others in her field, Lyubomirsky references studies that compare new lottery winners to recent paraplegic suffers. The shocking findings of these studies show that while lottery winners experience very elevated highs immediately after winning, and paraplegic sufferers experience very depressed lows immediately following their misfortunes, one year later both the lottery winners and the paraplegic suffers return to essentially the same state of life satisfaction that they experienced prior to their transformative events. Researchers
 have come to realize that the impacts of circumstances are relatively short-lived, and then we soon adjust our expectations and experiences of satisfaction to whatever “new normal” we have created. Perhaps you have heard of the term “hedonic adaptation,” which describes this exact phenomenon.
</p>
<p>Much of your work over the past four modules gave you insights into the circumstances you have tried in the past so that you have real-life, circumstantial experiences to use as a personal guide to judging where you felt harmony in your life experiences, and where you did not. From writing about your current situation, to considering how your strengths have been either embodied or impeded by your circumstances, you have a considerable audit of the situations that have served you and those that have not.
 </p>
<p>Between examining the elements of your personality set point, and auditing your past for insights about the types of circumstances that are most beneficial to you, you have a solid foundation of self-knowledge and strong reference points for making life decisions.
</p>
<p>But if 50% of life satisfaction is determined by your innate set point, and 10% is influenced by circumstances, what is the other 40%? We’re glad you asked, because the other 40% is what Lyubomirsky says is your greatest lever of “sustainable change,” and it is the result of intentional actions.
</p>
<p>In discussing this final 40%, Lyubomirsky did not just say intentions, because intentions alone without actions do not manifest, and therefore they do not impact your life. She also did not just say actions, because actions on their own without being grounded in considered intentions are just activity, but not necessarily pointed in an intended direction. The phrase intentional actions includes personal consideration, self-understanding, motive, design, and volition, combined with effort, embodiment and implementation. Intentional actions are rooted in your self-considered desires, and proactively move you and your life to where you want to go.
</p>
<p>Again, much of the work you did over the past four modules was designed to give you the insights and self-understanding to develop a sense of your intentions, as well as clarity about the types of actions you would need to enact in order to see your intentions begin to manifest in your life. From naming your deepest desires, to articulating how you want these to manifest in your relationships and environmental mastery, to listing what you need to break from and build toward, you now have an understanding of what you want, an articulation of how you intend to manifest your wants, and guidelines to assist you in acting on these to impact your life.
</p>

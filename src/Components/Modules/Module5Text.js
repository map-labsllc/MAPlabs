export const MOD_5_DESC = `<p>Each of the previous modules walked you through specific elements that build and nourish a life of meaning and purpose. This final module takes everything that you have completed to date and pulls it together into an organized process that helps you to create both a clarifying life purpose statement, and a set of commitments and goals that can direct your actions toward achieving your purpose.
</p>
<br />

<p>As we previously learned, there is a lot more to purpose than simply writing an inspirational sentence or two and posting it on the wall. Such statements have value only when they encapsulate a deep well of self-knowledge gained through reflection. But when they do, they serve as a useful shorthand that can be internalized and used as a guide through our everyday activities, sifting through the various pressures and incentives that come with them, helping us to remain focused on what truly matters to us.

<br />
<p>We will approach the task of articulating a purpose statement by developing a MAPmaker Dashboard. This will compile the most critical information created in MAPmaker thus far. The Dashboard will not only provide a context of self-understanding as you turn toward developing your life purpose statement, but it will also provide a quick-reference guide to which you can return on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis after completing the MAPmaker program.
</p>
<br />

<p>Module 5 develops the framework of your life purpose in four phases. As you will see, each phase is built from all of the work completed thus far in Modules 1 through 4. That way, your results are grounded in the weeks’ worth of thoughtful self-reflection, authentic self- knowledge, and personal strengths understanding that you have already developed.
</p>
<br />

<p>The first phase will establish the context of your purpose-seeking life by grounding you in a solid understand of where you are today, where you want to go in the future, and the key meaning and purpose themes that you discovered and articulated throughout the previous four modules.
</p>
<br />

<p>The second will focus on the “who,” that is, who you are based on the personal elements that you examined and articulated in the previous modules: your personal sense of meaning; your greatest desires, which arise out of your sense of meaning; and your signature strengths. These three elements represent who you are innately based on your values and beliefs, your deepest emotions, and your aptitudes and abilities. It is important that your sustainable sense of life purpose be rooted in the intrinsics of who you are, not in the extrinsic forces and influences around you. That’s why Module 5 grounds you in your authentic “who.”
</p>
<br />

<p>The third phase will focus on the “what,” that is, what you care about most that is beyond yourself. Lives of well-being, meaning, and purpose are not isolated, egotistical, or solipsistic. We are all social beings who live in relation to other friends and family, cultures and societies, and broader ideas and values. In fact, as mentioned in earlier modules, positive relationships are the number one indicator of well-being. So the third phase will seek to connect what you care about most that is beyond yourself, with your most authentic self that you focused on in the second phase.
</p>
<br />

<p>Establishing your context, acknowledging who you are, and articulating what you care about beyond yourself are the core elements of human purpose. After naming these, you will be able to form your own life purpose statement.
</p>
<br />

<p>The fourth phase will focus on the “how.” Here we consider how you will prepare yourself to implement your sense of purpose by leveraging two additional elements of life purpose, your commitments and goals. Every purpose statement implies a practical orientation, a way we intend to act in the world. Commitments are the heart of that intention, because
 implementing purpose can be hard, full of temptations along the way to drift into a path of least resistance. Commitment implies both a specific scope of action and a will to stay the course. You will likely revise your sense of purpose through experimentation along the way, but commitments ensure that the changes you make are deliberate, rather than reactive.
</p>
<br />

<p>With commitments in place, goals focus on how you will make good on your commitments on an everyday basis. They translate your intention to act into step-by-step execution.
</p>
<br />

<p>Congratulations on coming this far! For all the effort we exert in our various life tasks, very few people engage in the kind of self reflection that you have over the last four modules. We hope that this will be only a jumpstart in a lifelong journey toward purpose, but having worked through MAPmaker, you will have the core tools you need to make progress on your own.

export const QUES_510_DESC = `<p>Building your MAPmaker Dashboard. Over the last four modules, you created key summary statements about yourself and your needs. Below you will find the summary statement you created about your Current Situation. Take a moment to read it over and reflect on how accurate it feels now that you have nearly completed the program. Exercises 1, 2, 4, and 5 in this final module will give you an opportunity to revise the statements that you previously composed, and will conclude by building a dashboard that reflects this moment in your purpose journey. This dashboard will be presented in two different formats. The first is a more linear catalogue of your most important discoveries and conclusions, and it will serve as a quick-reference guide for you when you complete the MAPmaker program and begin to live more purposefully in your daily life. The second format maps each of the elements in your dashboard onto a model that demonstrates how you can envision your life of purpose building, from a rooted foundation in meaning, to the behavioral decisions necessary to enact life transformation.
</p>

<p><b>Revise and condense your Current Situation Statement.</b> Make sure this statement encompasses what you have learned through the first four modules so that it accurately reflects all of your understanding at this point. Does your description of your Current Situation feel accurate, authentic, comprehensive, and empowering to you? If so, feel free to leave it as it is. If not, revise or edit it to more accurately reflect your current self-knowledge and understanding. Since this statement will now become part of your “quick-reference” dashboard, try to consolidate it down into a simple, to-the-point synopsis of only the most important concepts in a few sentences.
</p>`

Add to your Dashboard your key themes. At the end of each module you were asked to articulate any key themes that arose for you around each module’s subject: feeling and experiences, values and beliefs, desires, and strengths. Review the themes that you wrote.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Do your themes feel accurate, authentic, comprehensive, and empowering to you? If so, feel free to leave them as they are. If not, revise or edit them to more accurately reflect your current self-knowledge and understanding.</li>
</li>Note which themes seem most critical to you, and which seem secondary. If your themes seem to overlap, try to consolidate them. Then choose only the most critical themes that you would like to add to your dashboard. Listing too many themes will cause you to lose focus, so try to only choose the most important 1 - 3 themes for your dashboard.</li>

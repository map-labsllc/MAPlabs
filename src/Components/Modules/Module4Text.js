export const MOD_4_DESC = `Meaning and purpose, at bottom, arise from kinds of self-knowledge.  They embody the living, active knowledge of what matters most to us.  They make sense of the world around us and how we fit into it.  And they direct us toward the unique contribution we hope to make to ourselves, others, and the world around us.
<br><br>
This has a practical implication for those of us who want a deeper sense of meaning and purpose: deep reflection must become part of our everyday lives.
<br><br>
What do we mean by “deep reflection”?  It is a practice of stepping back from the immediate claims on our attention, looking inward, observing our patterns of thought and feeling, asking why we think and feel as we do, and developing insight from that line of questioning about who we are most authentically.
<br><br>
That’s hard.
<br><br>
The ancient philosopher Socrates described self-knowledge as an elusive, but critical component of how one should live.  In modern times, scientists echo this sentiment in listing “thoughtful self-reflection” as a foundational element of developing life meaning and purpose.  As you will see, every module within MAPmaker offers exercises designed to provoke thoughtful self-reflection, and your willingness and efforts to engage in thoughtful self-reflections will in large measure determine  how successful you are in creating life transformation.
<br><br>
Most of us are afraid of what we will find when we truly know ourselves.  Or perhaps we are afraid of not finding much at all.  At any rate, our everyday lives are usually so full of distractions and claims on our attention and emotional energy that deep reflection is exceedingly rare.  MAPmaker gives you both a context and a methodology to evolve beyond this avoidance, and to embrace who you are at your deepest, most authentic self.
<br><br>
You will be doing a lot of reflection throughout MAPmaker (one of its long-term benefits for you, in fact, may be a habit of reflection that continues long after you are finished).  The purpose of this introductory module is to ease you into the program by offering exercises that help you to 1) reflect on your current life situation, and 2) think about how you would like your situation to change in the future.

export const QUES_410_DESC = `A list of phrases is provided that are generalized statements about the feelings or experiences you may have in your current life.  From the list of phrases provided, choose the ones that seem to best describe the feelings or experiences you have in your <i>current situation<i> (we will get to your future desired situation later), especially the ones that are most relevant, provocative, or resonant to you.`


export const QUES_420_DESC = `Using the phrases you chose, as well as the descriptions you created next to each one of them, write a full description of your current state of mind, state of being, and general assessment of your current condition today as you begin MAPmaker.  Create this description in your own image, capturing how you feel, what you think of your situation, what is good and bad, and how you would describe your current self to your future self.  The goal of this exercise is not only to ground yourself in deep self-reflection and honesty, but also to give you a benchmark of your current condition that you can reference in the future.  So be as honest, thorough, and as descriptive as you can be.`

List the areas of <i>personal growth</i> that will enable your life to be more filled with the core feelings and experiences you desire.

List any areas of <i>engagement</i> or <i>mastery</i> (either in your life’s work or avocationally) that would provide you with more of your core feelings and experiences.`

export const QUES_450_DESC = `Listing your desires is an important first step, one that can be hard. But there is more to do here. The next step is to go through a process of filtering that will allow you to decide which desires are most important to you within each category.
<br><br>
Within each category, compare the desires you listed, and make a tradeoff between each set of two, choosing only one of the two desires to carry into the next round.  For example, if you listed ten desires in one category, then compare your first listed desire to your second listed desire, and choose only one of them.  Then do the same for desires three and four, etc… At the end of round 1 you will have culled your desires in this category from ten to five.  Then do the same in the next round, and so on, until you only have one primary desire within the category.  Do this exercise for all seven categories until you only have one primary desire for each category.
<br><br>
This exercise has two main aims.
<br><br>
First, and most basically, it allows you to identify and focus on your deepest, most compelling desires, while letting other secondary desires fall to the sidelines. That will be valuable for developing your sense of purpose, since purpose is inherently based on what is most meaningful to you. Seeing what you choose as your most compelling desires, as well as seeing what you don’t choose, can help you to know what you are most striving for among a field of possible options.
<br><br>
Second, and more deeply, this exercise will give you an opportunity to be visceral rather than logical or reasonable, to sit in your body and feel your way through what is most important to you. Purpose is not something you reason your way into. The logic you use may very well stem from the unacknowledged expectations of others. Purpose takes root when you find yourself committed to something almost despite the better reasons one could find for taking another path. If the path makes sense to you, it has to make sense on the level of the heart, not just the head. As the philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote, 'The heart has reasons which the reason knows not.'
<br><br>
<i>A caveat:<i> when you get down to your last few desires, you may find that they are equally important, and you may want to combine some of them to come up with an optimal final desire. There will be an opportunity for you to make this kind of revision in the last two rounds.`


export const QUES_460_DESC = `When you are finished, you will be able to see all of your final desires for each category in one place. Think about them for a few minutes. Taken together, what do they suggest about the life that you desire? Also think about how you prioritized each category in your second tradeoff exercise. In the space provided, write a short statement that brings together all the desires from each category and captures the essence of what this exercise has revealed to you, using the phrases themselves. As you organize the statement, pay attention to how you prioritized among these desires.`

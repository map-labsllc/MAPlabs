<p>Module 4 of MAPmaker is a turning point.</p> 
<p>In Module 1 you assessed your current situation and dared to envision a more positive future for yourself.  In Module 2 you inventoried all of your influences and engaged in thoughtful self-reflection to differentiate your personal values and beliefs from those of others around you. In Module 3 you delved deeply into your most authentic self to acknowledge and embrace your greatest personal desires.</p> 
<p>You must be exhausted! </p>
<p>(But hopefully you are also enlivened with self-awareness, honesty, curiosity, and an enlarged sense of your personal possibility).</p> 
<p>In this module we will transition from deep, inwardly focused introspection, to begin focusing on how our authentic self can more optimally engage in the outward world around us.</p>

<p>Module 4 of MAPmaker is a turning point.</p> 
<p>In Module 1 you assessed your current situation and dared to envision a more positive future for yourself.  In Module 2 you inventoried all of your influences and engaged in thoughtful self-reflection to differentiate your personal values and beliefs from those of others around you. In Module 3 you delved deeply into your most authentic self to acknowledge and embrace your greatest personal desires.</p> 
<p>You must be exhausted! (But hopefully you are also enlivened with self-awareness, honesty, curiosity, and an enlarged sense of your personal possibility).</p> 
<p>In this module we will transition from deep, inwardly focused introspection, to begin focusing on how our authentic self can more optimally engage in the outward world around us. We will do this by examining the <i>Environmental mastery</i> element of the MAPPERS model of well-being.</p>
<p>Environmental mastery occurs when we know our personal values, beliefs, desires, and strengths, and we are able to manage and master our environments in order to effectively work with, and impact, the opportunities surrounding us. This means that we take all of the thoughtful self-reflection and discovery about our <i>values</i>, <i>beliefs</i>, and <i>desires</i>, and add to it an awareness of our personal <i>strengths</i>, that is, our aptitudinal orientations that come most naturally to us.</p>
<p>We all have core strengths and talents. But if we are not aware of them, our circumstances and habits can lead us to not act on some of our best attributes in our everyday lives. As we have already seen with our values, beliefs, and desires, it is common to find ourselves striving after things that others want for us or have influenced us to want. When we do so, it often causes us to be in situations where we use skills that may be highly esteemed, but that are not our core strengths. In fact, it is not uncommon for us to end up in jobs, careers, and other life situations that primarily demand our weaknesses or our middle strengths, rather than our core “signature” strengths. All the while, our true strengths lie dormant.</p>
<p>In the following exercises we will start by taking the VIA Survey of Character Strengths to discover our “signature strengths,” before examining the situations in our lives that embody and impede these strengths. Using this self-knowledge, we will consider how we can cultivate situations and specific opportunities to leverage our personal strengths in ways that allow both ourselves and the others we serve to flourish.</p>

export const MOD_4_DESC = `Module 4 of MAPmaker is a turning point.
<br><br> 
In Module 1 you assessed your current situation and dared to envision a more positive future for yourself.  In Module 2 you inventoried all of your influences and engaged in thoughtful self-reflection to differentiate your personal values and beliefs from those of others around you. In Module 3 you delved deeply into your most authentic self to acknowledge and embrace your greatest personal desires. 
<br><br>
You must be exhausted! (But hopefully you are also enlivened with self-awareness, honesty, curiosity, and an enlarged sense of your personal possibility).
<br><br>
In this module we will transition from deep, inwardly focused introspection, to begin focusing on how our authentic self can more optimally engage in the outward world around us. We will do this by examining the <i>Environmental mastery</i> element of the MAPPERS model of well-being.
<br><br>
Environmental mastery occurs when we know our personal values, beliefs, desires, and strengths, and we are able to manage and master our environments in order to effectively work with, and impact, the opportunities surrounding us. This means that we take all of the thoughtful self-reflection and discovery about our <i>values</i>, <i>beliefs</i>, and <i>desires</i>, and add to it an awareness of our personal <i>strengths</i>, that is, our aptitudinal orientations that come most naturally to us.
<br><br>
We all have core strengths and talents. But if we are not aware of them, our circumstances and habits can lead us to not act on some of our best attributes in our everyday lives. As we have already seen with our values, beliefs, and desires, it is common to find ourselves striving after things that others want for us or have influenced us to want. When we do so, it often causes us to be in situations where we use skills that may be highly esteemed, but that are not our core strengths. In fact, it is not uncommon for us to end up in jobs, careers, and other life situations that primarily demand our weaknesses or our middle strengths, rather than our core “signature” strengths. All the while, our true strengths lie dormant.
<br><br>
In the following exercises we will start by taking the VIA Survey of Character Strengths to discover our “signature strengths,” before examining the situations in our lives that embody and impede these strengths. Using this self-knowledge, we will consider how we can cultivate situations and specific opportunities to leverage our personal strengths in ways that allow both ourselves and the others we serve to flourish.`

// TODO... This is needs to be updated
export const QUES_410_DESC = `Once we understand our signature strengths, we can choose our everyday activities to be the things that we care about most and are most equipped to do well.
<br><br>
So how do we identify our signature strengths? The VIA Survey of Character Strengths identifies character traits that are universally admired across cultures and that apply to all of life, not just work or career. Martin Seligman and colleagues developed this survey by examining longstanding traditions of values and character strengths, including religions, philosophies, political writings, cultures, and educational practices. From this process emerged a set of 24 universal strengths.
<br><br>
While your signature strengths are your most important strengths, each of us has all 24 of the strengths in some measure. Your lower strengths are not the same as weaknesses—rather, they may be less valued, come less naturally to you, or be used less consistently in comparison to your core strengths.
<br><br>
<b>Take the VIA Survey of Character Strengths.</b> The survey is available for free on the University of Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Positive Psychology Center</a> website. Hover over the “Questionnaires” menu item, and click on the VIA Survey of Character Strengths (make sure to take the standard, adult version, not the “children” version).
<br><br>
Now that you have discovered your strengths, familiarize yourself with them. We highly recommend that you also read the more comprehensive definitions about your strengths for free on the <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths" target="_blank">VIA Institute of Character</a> website.
<br><br>
Enter your top 5 strengths below, in the order they are reported in the VIA Survey.`

export const QUES_420_DESC = `Now we want to make this exploration of strengths more concrete, by examining the experiences in our lives where our strengths have been clearly embodied (and we found satisfaction), versus experiences where our strengths have been impeded or absent (and we found frustration).
<br><br>
An <b><i>embodiment</b></i> is a task, a practice, or an experience in your life that calls upon your strength. You may have previously just thought of such embodiments in isolation as things you are good at or that feel natural to you. When we use our core strengths to meet a challenge that pushes us near our limits, we often experience a state of “flow,” a pleasant state of total absorption in which we lose all sense of time. Flow is a key component of well-being, and a state of everyday engagement that anyone seeking life satisfaction should pursue.
<br><br>
An <b><i>impediment</b></i> is something about your circumstances, yourself, or others that prevents you from acting on your strengths. When we are unable to act on our strengths in our everyday lives, we may experience a debilitating feedback loop that is two-sided. On one side, we feel a sense of personal frustration, a lack of fulfillment, and even a feeling of being “controlled,” because our situation forces us to act unnaturally and focus on activities that require our weaknesses. On the other side, we don’t feel satisfied by the things we are pursuing because our true strengths are not called for, leading to a further diminished sense of control and investment because we never get the satisfaction of excelling at what we do best.
<br><br>
For each strength below, list as many examples of embodiments or impediments of that strength as you can think of. Something that comes to mind from ten or twenty years ago is just as eligible as something from ten minutes ago. Write a simple word or short phrase that describes each embodiment or impediment that you add.`
